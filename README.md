# Introduction
This is a small default project for kotlin multi-platform which can be used as a starting point
to play around.

# Usage
Please do not touch the master when playing around. Either fork this project or use a dedicated branch for your games :D

# Notice
~~Make sure to use the EAP Version of Kotlin-Plugin (currently "1.3.70-eap-274") to make this work in IntelliJ.~~

~~Therefore, you can switch to the Early Access Preview channel in
Tools → Kotlin → Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates. 
Change the update channel to ‘Early Access Preview 1.3.x’ and press Check for updates now.~~

Kotlin-eap no longer needed (stable 1.3.70)
